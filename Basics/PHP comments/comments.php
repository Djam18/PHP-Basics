    A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.
    Comments can be used to:
        -Let others understand your code
        -Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code
        
    PHP supports several ways of commenting:    
    <?php

        //this a comment. More exactly a line comment.
        /*
          This a comment too. (Multiline comment)
         */
    ?>
